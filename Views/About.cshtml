            I kicked off into the fitness industry as a group instructor in 2013. I taught a variety of classes such
            as water aerobics, spin, bootcamp, and yoga. In 2015, I was in a car accident and additionally diagnosed
            with pelvic floor prolapse. In the coming months I began to notice a change in my body. High intensity
            workouts and repetitive exercises brought on migraines and running worsened prolapse. I began to experience
            new anxieties and overall tension in my body. I was no longer able to do what I could before. Often the
            human response to change is resistance; I did not accept my new normal and felt immense stress. My emotional
            gripping and straining only amplified the message my body was trying to send: something isnâ€™t working.
            Through the education of movement professionals, I learned grounding principles and was able to clear a
            path forward to trust my body. A change in trajectory might be someone or something. It can take time and
            lots of adjustment to discover what wellness means in our own bodies. I have spent the last 5 years learning
            and training in movement modalities and practices that help educate, support, and empower individuals. I
            hope my
            offered tools will give you support you need to stay steady on your path. I look forward
            to working together!
