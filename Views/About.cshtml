            A little more about me... I am a Mesa native, a wife, and a mother of three. Of course, yoga is a favorite
            pastime of mine. I love warm, soul-to-soul talks and sharing experiences. I became a fitness instructor in
            2013 and have enjoyed working at a variety of gyms over the years. In recent years, Iâ€™ve focused my teaching
            energy on melding physical training and release work. I now offer classes and personal instruction in your
            home or mine. You can also find me teaching and working out at AMP Fitness in Mesa.
